# 🌟 Parallax Effect Animated Website

Welcome to the **Parallax Effect Animated Website**! This project is a testament to my expertise in **animation and user experience design**, leveraging the power of **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)** to craft smooth, interactive, and visually appealing web experiences. 🚀  

With a keen eye for motion design and performance optimization, I have built this project to demonstrate how **seamless animations and parallax effects** can enhance storytelling, improve engagement, and create a more immersive user journey. This project is a blend of **modern frontend development** and **creative UI interactions**, designed to captivate users while maintaining a lightweight and efficient structure.  

Whether you're a recruiter, fellow developer, or just someone who loves animations, I hope this project inspires you! ✨
